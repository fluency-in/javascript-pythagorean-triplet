# JavaScript: Pythagorean Triplet

There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000. Find the product a * b * c.

A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, {a, b, c}, for
which,

```
a**2 + b**2 = c**2
```

For example, 

```
3**2 + 4**2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5**2.
```

These tests use jasmine-node, which is a testing framework written for Node.js.

You will need:

* Node.js
* The Node Package Manager (NPM)
* jasmine-node

You can install both Node.js and NPM with a download from nodejs.org: https://nodejs.org/en/download

Use NPM to install jasmine-node:

    npm install jasmine-node -g

To work on an exercise, change to the directory of the exercise:

    cd hello-world

This contains the files for the exercise.

    .
    ├── README.md
    └── hello-world.spec.js

To run a test file, pass it as an argument to the `jasmine-node` command:

    jasmine-node hello-world.spec.js
